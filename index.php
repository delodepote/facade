        <p>Facade is a lightweight browser window mockup in HTML & CSS. Here's an example:</p>

		<section class="facade-minimal" data-url="http://facade.pascalculator.be/">

    		<h1>No more Photoshop.</h1>
            <p>No more taking screenhots and trying to make them fit inside a layer that almost has the right dimensions, but not quite. Cut the crap and create your mockups straight in your HTML.</p>


            <h1>It's fluid.</h1>
            <p>Facade doesn't scale like a plain old responsive image, it adapts, just like a normal browser window would. If you're a bit like me, you're the kind of person that constantly resizes the browser window to see if something is responsive. Don't worry, it's been taken care of. Kick the tires a bit and drag that window. You know you want it!</p>

            <h1>Tiny, simple and clean.</h1>
            <p>Based on the beautiful minimal browser mockup done by <a href="http://www.jacobsawensten.com/">Jacob SÃ¤wensten</a>. One CSS file and one class name and you're good to go. Take a look at the <a href="#documentation">documentation</a>. Easy peasy.</p>

    	</section>

    		<h1 id="documentation">Documentation</h1>

    		<ul>
    			<li>Add <a href="http://facade.pascalculator.be/css/facade.css">facade.css</a> to you stylesheets</li>
    			<li>Create a block element, like a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>.</li>
    			<li>Slap the <code>facade-minimal</code> class on there</li>
    			<li>Add a <code>data-url</code> attribute and fill in your juicy mockup url</li>
                <li>Put your mockup content inside the element</li>
    			<li>Kick back and relax</li>
    		</ul>

            <p>Here's an example of the code:</p>
<pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/facade.css"&gt;
...
&lt;section class="facade-minimal" data-url="http://www.bowie-to-bowie.io"&gt; 
    &lt;h1&gt;Ground control to Major Tom...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>
                    <p>which will result into:</p>

                    <section class="facade-minimal" data-url="http://www.bowie-to-bowie.io" id="example">
                        <h1>Ground control to Major Tom...</h1>

    		<h1>About</h1>
    		<p></p>
            <p>If you were wondering why the heck anyone would ever need this, it was made because of some poor decisions I made when writing a PHP course - which you can <a href="https://github.com/pascalculator/web-backend">download for free on Github</a> (if you speak Dutch, that is). I quickly got fed up with making screenshots of how the output HTML should look like or updating them every time something changed.</p>

            <p>Since the output always was HTML-code I decided to create a little CSS framework that makes an element look like a browser window. That way I could show what the output should look like instead of having to take screenshots of the HTML. In the end I got a bit carried away and made this entirely in CSS, but it was a fun exercise and I like the fact that this is just one css-file (and admittedly some SVG wizardry) and one class. It's amazing what you can do with <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> elements. They've become my favorite CSS tools!</p>
